You have to install the library from the `npm` registry. You can do so by executing the following command:

For `npm`:
```
npm i @atomdevelops/minecraftjs
```

For `yarn`:
```
yarn add @atomdevelops/minecraftjs
```

MinecraftJS is pretty simple to get started with. All you need is to initialize the `MinecraftClient` and you're all set!
